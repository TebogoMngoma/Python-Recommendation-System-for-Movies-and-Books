    "A recommendation system is a software algorithm or system that suggests items, products, or content to users based on their preferences, behavior, or similarities to other users. These systems are designed to provide personalized and relevant recommendations, aiming to enhance user experience, engagement, and satisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommendation systems are crucial in various domains, including e-commerce, entertainment, social media, and content streaming platforms\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to build a Book recommendation system which can recommend us a book to read based on what are other read and also what books were rated the highest\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to use two types of methods for our Recommendation System namely Collaborative and Content Based Filtering , on this particular we will be using Content based filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "## Content Based Filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "This filtering method uses item features to recommend other items similar to what the user likes and also based on their previous actions or explicit feedback. If we consider the example for our book recommender system, the additional information can be the **Title**, the **Ratings**, the **Genre** e.t.c \n"
